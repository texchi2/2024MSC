## Methods:
Hargeisa Group Hospital (HGH) conducted a retrospective analysis of dengue fever cases registered from October 2022 to June 2024. Demographic data, including age and sex, as well as clinical outcomes, such as outpatient or inpatient status and mortality, were collected. The criteria for hospital admission, as per the HGH Dengue Fever Clinical Management Guideline (2022), included patients with warning signs of severe infection, severe dengue infection, dengue infection with coexisting conditions, elevated hematocrit (Hct>50%), leukopenia (WBC ≤5000 cells/mm³), thrombocytopenia (platelet count ≤100,000 cells/mm³), blood pressure <90/60 mmHg, and altered consciousness.

## Results:
From October 2022 to June 2024, a total of 2,871 patients with dengue fever (probable or laboratory confirmed?) were registered at HGH. Among these patients, 1,232 (42.9%) were male, and 1,639 (57.1%) were female. The majority of patients (2,036, 70.9%) received outpatient medical services, while 835 (29.1%) required hospital admission due to the severity of their illness.

The age distribution of the patients was as follows: 1,723 (60.0%) were under 30 years old, 774 (27.0%) were between 31 and 50 years old, and 374 (13.0%) were over 50 years old.

The total number of dengue fever-related deaths was 23, with a higher mortality rate observed among female patients. 

<!-- Compared to the previous years, the number of dengue cases increased from ??? in 2022 to ??? in 2023 and ??? in 2024 (up to June). The mortality rates were 0.?% (? deaths) in 2022, 0.?% (? deaths) in 2023, and 0.?% (? deaths) in 2024.
-->



<!--
Suggestions for improving the report:

1. Provide more detailed age stratification (e.g., 0-10, 11-20, 21-30 years) to better understand the age distribution of dengue fever cases; and report the case fatality rate (CFR) for each age group and sex to identify high-risk populations.

2. Include information on the monthly distribution of cases to assess seasonal trends and peak transmission periods.



7. Provide recommendations for future studies or interventions based on the findings, such as targeted vector control measures or public health education campaigns.
-->


## Discussion:
<!-- The increasing trend in dengue cases and mortality rates from 2022 to 2024 highlights the need for enhanced dengue control measures in Hargeisa. -->
The high proportion of cases among females and younger age groups suggests that targeted interventions should focus on these populations.

Limitations of this study include potential underreporting of cases, particularly among those with mild symptoms who may not seek medical care, and missing data on clinical characteristics and outcomes. Additionally, the study was conducted at OPD and ward for adults in Hargeisa Group hospital, which may not be representative of the entire population especially children under 18.

## Recommendations:
Based on the findings of this study, we recommend the following:

1. Strengthen vector control measures, particularly in areas with high dengue incidence, through community engagement and education on mosquito breeding site elimination.

2. Conduct targeted public health education campaigns focusing on dengue prevention and early recognition of symptoms, especially among females and younger age groups.

3. **Improve dengue surveillance systems** to capture a more accurate representation of the burden of disease in Hargeisa through ICDF Hospital Information System (HIS) at OPD and emergency department. (see next page)

4. Enhance the capacity of healthcare facilities to manage dengue cases effectively, with a focus on early identification and appropriate management of severe cases through laboratory confirmation.

5. Conduct further research to identify risk factors associated with severe dengue and mortality in the local context to inform targeted interventions.

In conclusion, this study highlights the increasing burden of dengue fever in Hargeisa and the need for strengthened prevention, control, and management strategies. Collaborative efforts between public health authorities, healthcare providers, and the community are essential to reduce the impact of dengue in the region.

# Improve dengue surveillance systems

To address Dr. Deq's recommendation and support the Ministry of Health and Development (MoHD) in strengthening the dengue fever surveillance system, the Taiwan Medical Mission (TMM) can focus on capacity building and knowledge transfer through the following steps:

1. Assess the current dengue fever surveillance system:
   - Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the existing surveillance system at the community, regional, and MoHD levels to identify gaps, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.
   - Engage with key stakeholders, including MoHD officials, WHO, UNICEF, and relevant NGOs, to understand their roles, responsibilities, and challenges in the current system.

2. Develop a capacity building plan:
   - Based on the assessment findings, develop a targeted capacity building plan that addresses the identified gaps and weaknesses in the surveillance system.
   - Prioritize areas for improvement, such as data collection, reporting, analysis, and dissemination, at each level of the system (community, regional, and MoHD).
   - Identify the necessary resources, including human resources, equipment, and technology, to support the capacity building efforts.

3. Implement DHIS2 and disease coding:
   - Support the MoHD in implementing DHIS2 as a centralized platform for integrating fragmented data from various sources, including NGOs, UNICEF, WHO, and MoHD.
   - Provide technical assistance and training to relevant personnel on the use of DHIS2 and its features, such as data entry, validation, analysis, and reporting.
   - Introduce standardized disease coding practices, such as ICD-10, to ensure consistency and comparability of dengue fever data across different sources and levels of the system.

4. Strengthen IDSR and HMIS:
   - Work with the MoHD to enhance the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) framework, focusing on dengue fever surveillance.
   - Provide training and mentorship to healthcare workers and surveillance officers on IDSR principles, including case detection, reporting, investigation, and response.
   - Support the integration of dengue fever surveillance into the existing Health Management Information System (HMIS) to improve data management, analysis, and utilization for decision-making.

5. Facilitate knowledge transfer and collaboration:
   - Organize workshops, seminars, and training sessions to facilitate knowledge transfer among stakeholders involved in dengue fever surveillance, including MoHD officials, healthcare workers, NGOs, and international organizations.
   - Encourage collaboration and information sharing among these stakeholders to foster a coordinated and effective surveillance system.
   - Identify and engage local champions within the MoHD and other organizations who can lead and sustain the capacity building efforts beyond TMM's involvement.

6. Monitor and evaluate progress:
   - Establish clear indicators and targets to monitor and evaluate the progress of the capacity building initiatives.
   - Regularly assess the performance of the dengue fever surveillance system and make necessary adjustments to the capacity building plan based on the findings.
   - Document lessons learned and best practices to inform future capacity building efforts and support the sustainability of the strengthened surveillance system.

By focusing on these key areas, TMM can effectively support the MoHD in strengthening the dengue fever surveillance system, improving data integration and management, and ultimately enhancing the country's capacity to detect, respond to, and control dengue fever outbreaks.
