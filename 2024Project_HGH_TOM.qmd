- Inactive people, smokers, or those who are very thin
- People with certain diseases like kidney problems or diabetes
- Those taking some medications, like steroids for asthma or arthritis

### What happens if you have osteoporosis?
- Back pain
- Getting shorter over time
- Bones that break easily, even from small falls
- Hunched back
- Hip fractures, which can be very serious for older people

### How to keep your bones healthy:
