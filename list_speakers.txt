"Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral infection, poses a significant global health challenge. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed comprehensive recommendations and strategies to effectively manage and control dengue outbreaks. This presentation outlines the key aspects of the WHO's approach to dengue fever, focusing on case definition, clinical course, screening algorithms, rapid diagnostic tests, fever history, and case management.
 
 The WHO has established a clear case definition for dengue fever, which includes clinical criteria such as fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, and rash. Understanding the clinical course of dengue is crucial for accurate diagnosis and timely intervention. The presentation will discuss the three phases of dengue: febrile, critical, and recovery.
 
 Screening algorithms play a vital role in identifying suspected dengue cases. The WHO recommends a stepwise approach that considers epidemiological and clinical factors. Rapid diagnostic tests, based on antigen or antibody detection, are essential tools for early confirmation of dengue infection. The presentation will highlight the advantages and limitations of these tests and their role in clinical decision-making.
 
 Taking a comprehensive fever history is crucial in dengue case management. The presentation will emphasize the importance of assessing the duration and pattern of fever, along with associated symptoms and risk factors. This information aids in distinguishing dengue from other febrile illnesses and guides appropriate treatment.
 
 The WHO has developed a case management strategy based on category groups A, B, and C. Category A includes patients who can be managed at home with simple measures such as fluid intake and rest. Category B patients require close monitoring for warning signs and may need intravenous fluid therapy. Category C represents severe dengue cases that require emergency treatment and intensive care.
 
 Severe dengue is a life-threatening condition that demands prompt recognition and management. The presentation will discuss the warning signs of severe dengue, such as persistent vomiting, severe abdominal pain, and respiratory distress. Close monitoring of vital signs, hematocrit levels, and fluid balance is essential to prevent complications and improve outcomes.
 
 In conclusion, the WHO's recommendations and strategies provide a comprehensive framework for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of dengue fever. By adhering to these guidelines, healthcare professionals can effectively respond to dengue outbreaks, reduce morbidity and mortality, and improve patient outcomes. Continued surveillance, research, and collaboration are necessary to combat this global health threat.
