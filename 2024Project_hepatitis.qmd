## Introduction

This report summarizes the current situation of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and other forms of viral hepatitis in Somalia, based on recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

## Prevalence of Viral Hepatitis

### Hepatitis B (HBV)

The epidemiology of viral hepatitis in Somalia shows a high prevalence of all forms of viral hepatitis, with chronic hepatitis B being the most common cause of chronic liver disease [@hassan2018epidemiology; @worldhealthorganization2017somalia].

- Overall pooled prevalence: 18.9% (95% CI: 14% to 29%) [@hassan2018epidemiology]
- Prevalence in specific groups:
  - Pregnant women: 20.5%
  - Children: 5.7%
  - Patients with chronic liver disease/hepatocellular carcinoma: 39.2% [@hassan2018epidemiology]

### Hepatitis C (HCV)

- Overall pooled prevalence: 4.84% (95% CI: 3.02% to 7.67%) [@hassan2018epidemiology]
- Prevalence in patients with chronic liver disease/hepatocellular carcinoma: 29.82% [@hassan2018epidemiology]

### Hepatitis D (HDV)

- Overall pooled prevalence: 28.99%
- Prevalence in patients with chronic liver disease/hepatocellular carcinoma: 43.77% [@hassan2018epidemiology]

### Hepatitis A (HAV)

While specific data for Hargeisa is not available, broader studies on Somalia provide insight:

- Overall pooled prevalence rate: 90.2% (95% CI: 77.8% to 96%) [@hassan2018epidemiology]
- Age-specific prevalence rates:
  - < 1 year old: 61.54%
  - 1-10 years old: 91.91%
  - 11-19 years old: 96.31%
  - 20-39 years old: 91.3%
  - > 40 years old: 86.96%

These high rates indicate that HAV is endemic in Somalia, with most people being exposed to the virus at a young age.

## Hepatitis in Hemodialysis Patients

A recent study on hemodialysis patients in Somalia found [@ahmed2021prevalence]:

- HBV prevalence: 7.3%
- HCV prevalence: 3.2%
- Co-infection (HBV and HCV): 0.5%

Risk factors associated with higher prevalence of HBV and HCV in hemodialysis patients included longer duration of hemodialysis, history of blood transfusion, and higher number of hemodialysis sessions per week [@ahmed2021prevalence].

## Public Health Challenges

The high prevalence of viral hepatitis, especially HBV, highlights the need for urgent public health interventions and strategic policy directions to control the disease burden in Somalia [@hassan2018epidemiology].

The World Health Organization's 2017 country profile for Somalia indicates limited infrastructure and policies for hepatitis testing and treatment [@worldhealthorganization2017somalia]. As of 2015, there were:

- No official guidelines for hepatitis B or C treatment
- No estimates of people on antiviral treatment for either HBV or HCV

## Conclusion

These findings underscore the significant public health challenge posed by viral hepatitis in Somalia and the need for improved prevention, testing, and treatment strategies.
