During this time, he has collaborated with the local general surgery team, participating in outpatient clinics, surgeries, and ward rounds. The initial assessment has revealed a significant opportunity to fulfill the shared aspirations of the TMM and the local general surgeons: the development of laparoscopic surgery in Somaliland. Currently, at least six attending physicians at HGH have had exposure to laparoscopic surgery during their specialist training in neighboring Ethiopia. However, due to the lack of necessary equipment at HGH, they have been unable to perform laparoscopic procedures. The attending physicians and residents in the general surgery department at HGH have expressed a strong interest in learning laparoscopic surgery under the guidance of Dr. Wang. Their proficiency in a wide range of open surgical techniques makes laparoscopy an area where Taiwanese surgeons can showcase their expertise."

Although Dr. Deq is unable to attend the conference in person due to prior commitments, his support and dedication to the improvement of public health in Somaliland have been truly remarkable.\nDr. Deq has graciously provided the conference organizers with the WHO-prepared Dengue slides, which will be presented by Dr. Jamal Tex Li-Hsing Chi, Chief of the Taiwan Medical Mission, and Dr. Ahmed Abdi Hersi, internal medicine specialist in Hargeisa Group Hospital. These slides contain crucial information on the WHO Dengue Fever Recommendations and Strategies, which will undoubtedly benefit the conference attendees and contribute to the overall success of the event.\nWe are deeply appreciative of Dr. Deq’s efforts in sharing this valuable resource with us, despite his inability to attend the conference. His commitment to advancing medical knowledge and promoting best practices in the management of dengue fever is commendable.\nOn behalf of the organizing committee, speakers, and attendees of the 2024 Multi-Specialty Conference, we extend our heartfelt thanks to WHO’s support and collaboration. We look forward to future opportunities to work together in the fight against dengue fever and other public health challenges facing Somaliland."
