Although Dr. Deq is unable to attend the conference in person due to prior commitments, his support and dedication to the improvement of public health in Somaliland have been truly remarkable.\nDr. Deq has graciously provided the conference organizers with the WHO-prepared Dengue slides, which will be presented by Dr. Jamal Tex Li-Hsing Chi, Chief of the Taiwan Medical Mission, and Dr. Ahmed Abdi Hersi, internal medicine specialist in Hargeisa Group Hospital. These slides contain crucial information on the WHO Dengue Fever Recommendations and Strategies, which will undoubtedly benefit the conference attendees and contribute to the overall success of the event.\nWe are deeply appreciative of Dr. Deq’s efforts in sharing this valuable resource with us, despite his inability to attend the conference. His commitment to advancing medical knowledge and promoting best practices in the management of dengue fever is commendable.\nOn behalf of the organizing committee, speakers, and attendees of the 2024 Multi-Specialty Conference, we extend our heartfelt thanks to WHO’s support and collaboration. We look forward to future opportunities to work together in the fight against dengue fever and other public health challenges facing Somaliland."

    "text": "Summary\nThis study, conducted by Hussein Mohamoud Nour, Mohamed Abdiqadir Ahmed, and Alemayehu Bayray Kahsay, is the first scientific publication on dengue fever in Somaliland. The cross-sectional study aimed to estimate the prevalence of dengue fever by detecting DENV-specific antibodies (IgM/IgG) among patients with febrile illness attending Edna Adan University Hospital in Hargeisa, Somaliland, from October to November 2022.\n\nKey Results\n\nThe overall incidence rate of dengue virus infection among patients with febrile illness was 37% (20 out of 54 patients).\nA higher incidence rate of dengue fever (5.9%) was observed in patients older than 50 years, followed by 5.6% in patients aged between 41-50 years.\nAmong the dengue-positive patients, 50% tested positive for IgG, 35% for IgM, and 15% for both IgG and IgM.\nFactors such as gender (p&lt;0.007), presence of fever (p&lt;0.001), and retro-orbital pain were significantly associated with dengue seropositivity.\n\n\n\nDiscussion Highlights\n\nThis study confirms the circulation of DENV in Somaliland and the presence of the Aedes mosquito species in all regions of the country.\nThe incidence rate of 37% is comparable to studies conducted in India (31.5%) and Eritrea (33.3%), but higher than those reported in north-southern Nigeria (18%), Jordan (24.6%), and Lagos (24.9%).\nThe high prevalence of dengue IgG (50%) indicates that a large proportion of the population has been exposed to DENV during the outbreak in the country.\nThe study emphasizes the need for improved vector control measures, entomology studies, and a strong surveillance system in Somaliland, given the impact of climate change on the emergence and re-emergence of vector-borne diseases.\nFuture large-scale investigations and molecular detection are warranted to discover different virus serotypes and better understand the epidemiology of dengue fever in Somaliland.\n\nIn conclusion, this study provides the first evidence of dengue virus infection circulation in Somaliland and highlights the need for enhanced prevention, control, and surveillance measures to address this emerging public health threat.\n\n\nSevere dengue\nThe correlation between re-infection with a different DENV serotype and severe dengue can be explained by the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) phenomenon. When an individual is infected with one DENV serotype, they develop antibodies specific to that serotype. However, if they are later infected with a different DENV serotype, the pre-existing antibodies may not neutralize the virus effectively. Instead, these antibodies can enhance the entry of the virus into host cells, leading to increased viral replication and a more severe form of the disease, known as severe dengue or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF).\nFactors contributing to severe dengue include:\n\nPrevious infection with a different DENV serotype, leading to ADE.\nHost genetic factors that may influence the immune response to DENV infection.\nVirulence of the specific DENV strain causing the infection.\nAge of the patient, with children and older adults being more susceptible to severe dengue.\nPresence of comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, or chronic kidney disease.\n\n\n\nCritical challenge questions for the author, Hussein Mohamoud Nour:\n\nWhat was the timing of blood sample collection for the study participants in relation to the onset of fever? This is crucial because the presence of NS1 antigen, IgM, and IgG antibodies varies depending on the stage of infection.\n\nNS1 antigen is detectable early in the course of infection, typically from day 1 to day 9 after the onset of symptoms.\nIgM antibodies appear around 3-5 days after the onset of symptoms and can persist for several weeks to a few months.\nIgG antibodies develop about a week after the onset of symptoms and can persist for several years.\n\nWhy was NS1 antigen not checked in this study? NS1 antigen testing is a valuable tool for early diagnosis of dengue fever, as it can be detected before the appearance of antibodies. Including NS1 antigen testing could have provided a more comprehensive picture of the prevalence of dengue virus infection in the study population.\nIs there a possibility of underestimating the number of cases based on IgM or IgG antibodies if blood samples were drawn at the time of admission? If blood samples were collected very early in the course of infection, IgM and IgG antibodies might not have developed yet, leading to false-negative results and an underestimation of the true prevalence of dengue virus infection.\n\nAddressing these questions would help clarify the study’s methodology and strengthen the interpretation of the findings. Furthermore, the inclusion of NS1 antigen testing in future studies could provide a more accurate assessment of the burden of dengue fever in Somaliland."

    "title": "Cervical Cancer in Somaliland: Burden, Barriers, and Opportunities for Prevention",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background:\nCervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths among women in Africa, with an estimated age-standardized incidence rate of 25.1 per 100,000 in Somalia (Bruni et al., 2023). Approximately 95% of cervical cancer cases are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, particularly from high-risk genotypes (Muñoz et al., 2003). Despite this high regional burden, specific data on cervical cancer epidemiology in Somaliland is limited. The tertiary hospital in Somalia recorded a total of 1306 cancer cases from 2017 to 2020. Among these instances, 13.3% were cervical cancer and 13.1% were breast cancer. Cervical cancer ranked as the second most prevalent cancer in women, while breast cancer ranked third (Tahtabasi et al., 2020). Local healthcare providers at Hargeisa Group Hospital (HGH) anecdotally report cervical cancer as rare, contrasting with findings from Somali immigrant populations in the United States and Europe showing higher disease rates (Grimm et al., 2017, Idehen et al., 2017).\nThe key points regarding cervical cancer prevention and control strategies in Somaliland:\n\nKnowledge and awareness about cervical cancer, its risk factors, screening methods like HPV DNA, Pap smears, and prevention through HPV vaccination is very low among Somali women (Altunkurek et al., 2024; Grimm et al., 2017; Ghebre et al., 2015). Many Somali women are not familiar with cervical cancer screening tests and concepts.\nThere is a lack of national cervical cancer screening programs and HPV vaccination programs in Somalia (Altunkurek et al., 2024) and Somaliland. Constraints in implementing and sustaining screening programs have limited the effectiveness of secondary prevention efforts.\nPrimary prevention through HPV vaccination is identified as a cost-effective preventive measure, but none of the Somali students surveyed had received the HPV vaccine (Altunkurek et al., 2024). Establishing national HPV vaccination strategies is recommended in Somaliland.\nBarriers to cervical cancer screening among Somali women include limited knowledge, language difficulties, fear of the test, embarrassment exposing one’s body, negative past experiences, and cultural factors like preferring female providers (Grimm et al., 2017; Ghebre et al., 2015).\nEfforts are needed to increase awareness through culturally-appropriate health education programs targeting Somali women and their families (especially Somali Men) about cervical cancer, HPV, and prevention methods (Altunkurek et al., 2024; Ghebre et al., 2015).\nInvolving Somali men, who are often the key decision-makers in households, in cervical cancer prevention education could help increase uptake of screening and HPV vaccination among Somali women and adolescents (University of Minnesota, 2015).\n\nIn summary, the literature highlights low levels of cervical cancer awareness and limited access to screening and vaccination services as major gaps in Somaliland and Somalia. Implementing national prevention programs, educational interventions tailored to Somali communities, and involving male household decision-makers are recommended strategies to improve cervical cancer control efforts in line with WHO goals (Altunkurek et al., 2024; University of Minnesota, 2015; Ghebre et al., 2015).\nAccurate local data is critical for informing prevention and control strategies aligned with WHO’s global cervical cancer elimination targets. HPV infection, the primary cause of cervical cancer, can be detected through screening tests like Pap smears and HPV DNA assays. Screening provides an opportunity to identify precancerous lesions and early-stage cancers amenable to treatment.\n\n\nObjectives:\n\nDetermine the prevalence of HPV infection and cervical abnormalities among women attending HGH\nRaise awareness of cervical cancer burden and value of screening among HGH clinicians\nEstablish feasibility of implementing routine cervical cancer screening in the HGH setting\nTrain HGH pathologist doctors on organizing pathology data and contributing to cancer registries\n\n\n\nMethods:\nWe propose a pilot cross-sectional study of 500 women aged 30-49 presenting to HGH obstetrics and gynecology clinics. After informed consent, participants will undergo: - Pap smear and HPV DNA testing - Brief risk factor survey - Education on cervical cancer prevention\nPap smears will be processed and interpreted locally by trained HGH laboratory staff, with quality assurance review by TMM pathologists. HPV DNA samples will be analyzed using a validated PCR-based assay.\nResults will be reported back to participants with appropriate follow-up recommendations. Aggregated, de-identified data will be shared with HGH clinicians, highlighting the proportion of women with positive screening results.\nHGH pathologist doctors will receive training on systematically documenting and organizing pathology data from cervical specimens. They will learn best practices for contributing this data to hospital-based and national cancer registries to track cervical cancer trends over time.\n\n\nPotential Challenges:\n\nLow perceived need for screening among clinicians\nCultural sensitivity around discussing sexually transmitted infections\nLimited laboratory infrastructure and personnel\n\n\n\nStrategies:\n\nEngage HGH leadership as champions to promote screening\nFrame messaging around cancer prevention benefits\nProvide intensive laboratory training and remote telepathology support\n\n\n\nExpected Outcomes:\nQuantifying the burden of HPV infection and cervical abnormalities in this pilot study will provide critical local data to inform future screening implementation. We anticipate identifying a substantial number of high-risk women who can benefit from treatment and surveillance. Uncovering a higher than expected burden would challenge assumptions about low cervical cancer incidence in Somaliland and reinforce the need for routine screening aligned with WHO elimination goals. Successful completion will demonstrate the feasibility and value of screening in this setting.\nImproved pathology data management and cancer registry reporting by HGH pathologists will enable ongoing monitoring of cervical cancer epidemiology. This data can guide resource allocation and evaluate the impact of prevention efforts over time.\n\n\nBudget Considerations:\n\nPap smear and HPV DNA testing supplies\nLaboratory equipment and training\nPatient/provider education materials\nData management and analysis software\nPersonnel time for study coordination, specimen processing, and results reporting\nTraining for HGH pathologists on data organization and cancer registry reporting\n\n\n\nReferences:\nBruni L, Albero G, Serrano B, Mena M, Collado JJ, Gómez D, Muñoz J, Bosch FX, de Sanjosé S.
