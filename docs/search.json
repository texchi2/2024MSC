This initiative aims to introduce and develop laparoscopic surgery techniques among the general surgery department at HGH, under the guidance of Dr. Yen-Hsiang Wang, a visiting surgeon from Taipei Municipa Wanfang Hospital (TMWH), Taiwan.\n\n\nDr. Yen-Hsiang Wang, a general surgeon from TMWH, has been working with the TMM in Somaliland for nearly four weeks. During this time, he has collaborated with the local general surgery team, participating in outpatient clinics, surgeries, and ward rounds. The initial assessment has revealed a significant opportunity to fulfill the shared aspirations of the TMM and the local general surgeons: the development of laparoscopic surgery in Somaliland. Currently, at least six attending physicians at HGH have had exposure to laparoscopic surgery during their specialist training in neighboring Ethiopia. However, due to the lack of necessary equipment at HGH, they have been unable to perform laparoscopic procedures. The attending physicians and residents in the general surgery department at HGH have expressed a strong interest in learning laparoscopic surgery under the guidance of Dr. Wang. Their proficiency in a wide range of open surgical techniques makes laparoscopy an area where Taiwanese surgeons can showcase their expertise."
