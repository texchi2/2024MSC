Although Dr. Deq is unable to attend the conference in person due to prior commitments, his support and dedication to the improvement of public health in Somaliland have been truly remarkable.\nDr. Deq has graciously provided the conference organizers with the WHO-prepared Dengue slides, which will be presented by Dr. Jamal Tex Li-Hsing Chi, Chief of the Taiwan Medical Mission, and Dr. Ahmed Abdi Hersi, internal medicine specialist in Hargeisa Group Hospital. These slides contain crucial information on the WHO Dengue Fever Recommendations and Strategies, which will undoubtedly benefit the conference attendees and contribute to the overall success of the event.\nWe are deeply appreciative of Dr. Deq’s efforts in sharing this valuable resource with us, despite his inability to attend the conference. His commitment to advancing medical knowledge and promoting best practices in the management of dengue fever is commendable.\nOn behalf of the organizing committee, speakers, and attendees of the 2024 Multi-Specialty Conference, we extend our heartfelt thanks to WHO’s support and collaboration. We look forward to future opportunities to work together in the fight against dengue fever and other public health challenges facing Somaliland."
