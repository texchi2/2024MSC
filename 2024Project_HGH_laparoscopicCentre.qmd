## Project Overview
The Taiwan Medical Mission (TMM) in the Republic of Somaliland, in collaboration with the Hargeisa Group Hospital (HGH), proposes the establishment of a Laparoscopic Training Center to enhance surgical care and improve patient outcomes in the region. This initiative aims to introduce and develop laparoscopic surgery techniques among the general surgery department at HGH, under the guidance of Dr. (Andrew) Yen-Hsiang Wang, a visiting surgeon from Taipei Municipal Wanfang Hospital (TMWH), Taiwan.

### Background and Rationale

Dr. (Andrew) Yen-Hsiang Wang, a general surgeon from TMWH, has been working with the TMM in Somaliland for more than three months. During this time, he has collaborated with the local general surgery team, participating in outpatient clinics, surgeries, and ward rounds.
The initial assessment has revealed a significant opportunity to fulfill the shared aspirations of the TMM and the local general surgeons: **the development of laparoscopic surgery in Hargeisa Group Hospital**.
Currently, at least six attending physicians at HGH have had exposure to laparoscopic surgery during their specialist training in neighboring Ethiopia. However, due to the lack of necessary equipment at HGH, they have been unable to perform laparoscopic procedures.
The attending physicians and residents in the general surgery department at HGH have expressed a strong interest in developing laparoscopic surgery. Their proficiency in a wide range of open surgical techniques makes laparoscopy an area where Taiwanese surgeons can showcase their expertise.

## Project Objectives

- Establish a Laparoscopic Training Center at Hargeisa Group Hospital.
- Train attending physicians and residents in laparoscopic surgical techniques.
- Foster collaboration and knowledge exchange between Taiwanese and Somaliland surgeons.

## Implementation Plan

1. Dr. Wang will develop a comprehensive laparoscopic surgery training curriculum, tailored to the needs and resources of HGH.

2. The TMM kindly requests the Teaching Department of TMWH to support a laparoscopic simulator and instruments.

3. Dr. Wang will conduct hands-on training sessions, demonstrations, and supervised laparoscopic procedures during his time in Somaliland.

<!-- 4. The TMM will explore the possibility of procuring laparoscopic equipment for HGH, with the aim of providing long-term benefits to the people of Somaliland.

## Future Prospects

In 2025, Dr. Mrr Kuan, a general surgeon from Tong General Hospital (Taiwan), is expected to join the TMM in Somaliland. The establishment of the Laparoscopic Training Centre will lay the foundation for continued training and development in minimally invasive surgery.

The TMM will work towards securing funds for the procurement of laparoscopic equipment, ensuring the sustainability and long-term impact of the project.
