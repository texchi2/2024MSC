title: "Project OT construction in HGH"
---

A clear agreement between the Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and Australian Doctors for Africa (ADFA) regarding the operation theater (OT) construction plan at Hargeisa Group Hospital (HGH). The following points should be considered when drafting the agreement:

Based on "Taiwan Centre" contruction plan at HGH (Plan A) by survey and planning in 2023,

a) Scope of the project: The agreement should clearly define the scope of the project, which involves the construction of four operation theater rooms (Plan B) at HGH.

b) Financial contributions: The agreement should outline the financial contributions from both ADFA and the Taiwan Embassy, with the budget being sourced from Taiwan MOFA. It should specify the exact amount or percentage of the total cost that each party will cover.

c) Responsibilities: The agreement should delineate the responsibilities of each party involved. For example, ADFA may be responsible for overseeing the construction process, while TMM, under the guidance of the Taiwan Embassy and with approval from Taiwan MOFA, may be responsible for suggesting and sourcing essential medical equipment for the OTs.

d) Timeline: The agreement should include a detailed timeline for the project, specifying key milestones such as the start and completion dates of construction, as well as the installation of medical equipment.

e) Communication and reporting: The agreement should establish clear communication channels between ADFA, TMM, and the Taiwan Embassy, as well as reporting requirements to ensure transparency and accountability throughout the project.

f) Intellectual property and branding: The agreement should address any intellectual property rights and branding guidelines, such as the use of logos and acknowledgment of each party's contributions in public communications related to the project.

g) Dispute resolution: The agreement should include a dispute resolution mechanism to address any potential conflicts or disagreements that may arise during the course of the project.

h) Sustainability and future collaboration: The agreement may also outline plans for future collaboration between ADFA and TMM to ensure the long-term sustainability and effectiveness of the OTs at HGH.

By carefully considering these points and drafting a comprehensive agreement, Taiwan MOFA and ADFA can establish a strong foundation for a successful collaboration on the OT construction project at HGH. This agreement will help ensure that all parties involved have a clear understanding of their roles, responsibilities, and expectations, ultimately contributing to the project's success and the improvement of healthcare services in Somaliland.
