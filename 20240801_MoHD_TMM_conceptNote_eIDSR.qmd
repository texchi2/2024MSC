## Introduction

The integration of electronic Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (eIDSR) in Somaliland presents a significant opportunity to enhance the detection, reporting, and management of **acute febrile illnesses**, particularly dengue fever. This concept note outlines the proposed implementation of eIDSR, focusing on the use of DHIS2 and the integration of advanced diagnostic tools.

## Current Status

- DHIS2 and **paper-based** IDSR are currently implemented in MoHD
- Unvalidated dengue RDT test kits in use, leading to potential false negatives
- GeneReach Pockit PCR machines available: 4 in HGH, 1 each in Boroma, Burco, and Berbera general hospitals


## Objectives

1. Implement an eIDSR system using DHIS2 for improved dengue fever surveillance
2. Enhance the accuracy of dengue fever diagnosis through quality control measures
3. Strengthen the capacity for early outbreak detection and response
4. Improve data-driven decision-making in public health management

## Methodology

### eIDSR Framework Implementation

1. DHIS2 Integration:
   - Deploy DHIS2 mobile app for automatic reporting from community level
   - Integrate a pilot of LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) in public hospitals
   - Link clinical and epidemiological data from ICDF HIS using established case definitions in HGH, Boroma, Burco, and Berbera general hospitals

2. Enhanced Dengue Diagnosis:
   - Implement quality control measures for RDTs:
     * 10% sampling of RDT negative cases for PCR confirmation
     * Utilize GeneReach Pockit PCR machines for dengue virus RNA detection

3. Reporting Workflow:
   a. Community-level reporting via DHIS2 mobile app in android cell phone
   b. Automatic integration of laboratory results through LIMS (with HIS in hospitals)
   c. Verification by district officers
   d. Data analysis and response at MoHD level

## Meeting Minutes [2024/08/01]

1. Finalize technical specifications for system integration:

stage I: LabPush-SLN
1) [tracking] all suspected and confirmed (NS1) dengue fever cases will be reported to DHIS2 in daily basis, for initial disease surveillance.
then, 
2) [diagnosis] TMM will try to support NS1 RDTs to HGH lab as Dr. Hergeye’s request under emergency endemic situation. all donated RDTs must be tracked under this surveillance system, LabPush-SLN.

stage II: DHIS2 Android Capture App for communities

2. Develop a detailed implementation timeline
3. Secure necessary resources and partnerships for full-scale rollout
4. Conduct a stakeholder meeting to present and refine the concept

This concept note provides a framework for discussion and further development of the eIDSR system in Somaliland, with a focus on enhancing dengue fever surveillance through improved technology integration and quality control in diagnosis.

## The (draft) formal letter to TMM highlights the current challenges with the dengue fever surveillance system and makes a strong case for implementing eIDSR.

[Ministry of Health and Development Letterhead]

Dr. Jamal Tex LH Chi
Taiwan Medical Mission in the Republic of Somaliland

Dear Dr. Tex,

Subject: Request for Support in Implementing Electronic Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (eIDSR) for Dengue Fever Control

I hope this letter finds you well. On behalf of the Ministry of Health and Development (MoHD) of Somaliland, I am writing to formally request support from Taiwan Medical Mission (TMM) in implementing an Electronic Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (eIDSR) system, with a specific focus on enhancing our dengue fever surveillance and control efforts.

The current dengue fever situation in Somaliland is of significant concern, and our existing surveillance system faces several challenges that hinder our ability to respond effectively. Allow me to present some key evidence that underscores the urgent need for an improved surveillance system:

1. Data Fragmentation and Inconsistency:
   - From October to December 2023, 2,635 cases of dengue fever were reported, with 734 testing positive (27.9%) using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs).
   - However, another report indicates 6,394 suspected dengue fever cases from September 2023 to January 2024, with a peak in November 2023.
   - Hargeisa Group Hospital (HGH) alone registered 2,871 dengue fever patients from October 2022 to June 2024, but the laboratory results for these cases are unknown.

These discrepancies highlight the fragmentation of our current paper-based IDSR system and the urgent need for a unified, electronic system.

2. Inadequate RDT Distribution and Utilization Tracking:
   - In December 2023, 20,000 RDTs were received, but records of their distribution and usage are incomplete.
   - HGH laboratory received only 1,512 dengue NS1 RDTs (December 2023 to June 27, 2024), with a positivity rate of 25.9%.
   - The distribution of the remaining 18,488 RDTs is unclear, indicating a lack of proper tracking and inventory management.

3. Incomplete Demographic Data:
   - The demographic data of those tested with RDTs is incomplete, hindering our ability to understand the population most affected by dengue fever.

4. Lack of Coordination in Vector Control:
   - The responsibility for Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) for mosquito control has been delegated to the Ministry of Agriculture, leading to a disconnect between case detection and vector control efforts.

Given these challenges, we believe that implementing an eIDSR system would significantly enhance our ability to track, respond to, and control dengue fever outbreaks. The eIDSR system would address the following key areas:

1. Real-time data collection and reporting
2. Improved data accuracy and consistency
3. Enhanced ability to identify outbreak hotspots
4. Better coordination between case detection and response activities
5. Improved inventory management of diagnostic tools (RDTs)

Additionally, we support the recommendation to focus on improving the quality control of RDTs, aiming to reduce the false negative rate to below 5%.

We kindly request TMM's support in the following areas:

1. Technical expertise in setting up and implementing the eIDSR system
2. Training for our staff in using the eIDSR system effectively
3. Support in establishing a quality control mechanism for RDTs
4. Guidance on integrating the eIDSR system with our existing health information systems (i.e., District Health Information Software 2, DHIS2)

To facilitate this process, we have prepared a detailed **outline for requesting comprehensive dengue fever data** from our DHIS2 system by Mr. Abdilahi, which will serve as a crucial foundation for the eIDSR implementation and help TMM better understand the current gaps in our surveillance system.

We believe that this project aligns well with TMM's expertise and Somaliland's public health priorities. By focusing on strengthening our surveillance system rather than IRS, we can more effectively allocate resources to combat dengue fever.

We look forward to collaborating with TMM on this crucial initiative. Please let us know if you require any additional information or clarification.

Thank you for your continued support and partnership in improving public health in Somaliland.

Sincerely,

Mr. Mahdi Dahir Bahdon

Director of Public Health Department (MoHD)
