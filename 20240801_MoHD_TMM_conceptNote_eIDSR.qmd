## Introduction

The integration of electronic Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (eIDSR) in Somaliland presents a significant opportunity to enhance the detection, reporting, and management of **acute febrile illnesses**, particularly dengue fever. This concept note outlines the proposed implementation of eIDSR, focusing on the use of DHIS2 and the integration of advanced diagnostic tools.

## Current Status

- DHIS2 and **paper-based** IDSR are currently implemented in MoHD
- Unvalidated dengue RDT test kits in use, leading to potential false negatives
- GeneReach Pockit PCR machines available: 4 in HGH, 1 each in Boroma, Burco, and Berbera general hospitals


## Objectives

1. Implement an eIDSR system using DHIS2 for improved dengue fever surveillance
2. Enhance the accuracy of dengue fever diagnosis through quality control measures
3. Strengthen the capacity for early outbreak detection and response
4. Improve data-driven decision-making in public health management

## Methodology

### eIDSR Framework Implementation

1. DHIS2 Integration:
   - Deploy DHIS2 mobile app for automatic reporting from community level
   - Integrate a pilot of LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) in public hospitals
   - Link clinical and epidemiological data from ICDF HIS using established case definitions in HGH, Boroma, Burco, and Berbera general hospitals

2. Enhanced Dengue Diagnosis:
   - Implement quality control measures for RDTs:
     * 10% sampling of RDT negative cases for PCR confirmation
     * Utilize GeneReach Pockit PCR machines for dengue virus RNA detection

3. Reporting Workflow:
   a. Community-level reporting via DHIS2 mobile app in android cell phone
   b. Automatic integration of laboratory results through LIMS (with HIS in hospitals)
   c. Verification by district officers
   d. Data analysis and response at MoHD level

  }
")
```


### Implementation Steps

1. Technical Setup:
   - Configure DHIS2 for dengue fever surveillance
   - Integrate LIMS with existing hospital systems
   - Ensure interoperability between DHIS2, LIMS, and ICDF HIS

2. Training:
   - Conduct training sessions for community health workers on DHIS2 mobile app
   - Train laboratory staff on LIMS and quality control procedures
   - Educate district officers on data verification processes

3. Quality Assurance:
   - Establish protocols for PCR confirmation of RDT negative cases
   - Implement regular system audits and data quality assessments

## Expected Results

1. Improved timeliness and accuracy of dengue fever surveillance
2. Enhanced quality control of diagnostic tests
3. Real-time data availability for evidence-based decision making
4. Strengthened capacity for early outbreak detection and response
5. Reduced **false negatives** in dengue diagnosis
6. Improved **patient outcomes** through more accurate and timely diagnoses

## Monitoring and Evaluation

- Set up dashboards for real-time monitoring of dengue fever cases
- Conduct monthly reviews of system performance and data quality
- Perform quarterly evaluations of the impact on dengue fever surveillance and response

## Next Steps

1. Finalize technical specifications for system integration
2. Develop a detailed implementation timeline
3. Secure necessary resources and partnerships for full-scale rollout
4. Conduct a stakeholder meeting to present and refine the concept

This concept note provides a framework for discussion and further development of the eIDSR system in Somaliland, with a focus on enhancing dengue fever surveillance through improved technology integration and quality control in diagnosis.
